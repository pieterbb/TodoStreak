## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo
2. Copy the .env.example file to a .env file in the root directory of the repo

```bash
 cp .env.example .env
```

- Replace the placeholder variables in the .env file with your credentials
  - You need a [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) API key for image uploads and [TinyMCE API](https://www.tiny.cloud/) key for the WYSIWYG editor
  - You need a Postgres database
    - you can use a free serverless Postgres database from [Neon](https://neon.tech/) for example
  - You need a SMTP mail server so Next-Auth can send login emails
    - You can use Gmail, your own SMTP email server or a service like [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/smtp-service)
  - You need [Discord](https://discord.com/developers/applications) & [Google OAuth API](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en) keys for logging in with these platforms
    - You can also disable them by deleting them from the provider array and deleting the environment variables so you can just use email magic link login
      ```
      /src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
      ```

3. **OPTIONAL:** Set the root domain name you are using for your production deployment by setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL:`

   ```
   /src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
   ```

   ```Javascript
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL: process.env.VERCEL
     ? process.env.VERCEL_ENV === 'production'
   	? 'https://www.YOURDOMAIN.com'
   	: `https://${process.env.VERCEL_URL}`
     : 'http://localhost:3000',
   ```

   Replace 'yourdomain.com' with the domain you want to use.

4. Run the following commands to install the dependencies, initialise the database and start the development server

```shell
npm install
npm run prisma:migrate
npm run prisma:generate
npm run dev
```

5. **OPTIONAL**: Run this to seed the database with dummy data

```shell
npx prisma db seed
```

6. **OPTIONAL**: Deploy the application on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

   - If not deploying on Vercel, strip out the Vercel analytics in `package.json` and the root layout
     ```json
     "@vercel/analytics": "^1.0.2",
     "@vercel/speed-insights": "^1.0.1",
     ```

7. That's it, you can now run the application, create an account and do whatever you want. Have fun!

## Feature ideas to implement

- Create a marketing / landing page to explain the platform to new users
- Use a component library like Mantine or Shadcn UI
- Add CSP headers and other basic security features to stop XSS and other attacks
- Narrow return data from Prisma queries or use DTO Pattern to prevent over-fetching and exposing sensitive data
- Build a custom Login / Logout page
- Create pagination for the todofeed in the URL, so the position is shareable
- Replace TinyMCE with an open source WYSIWYG editor like TipTap
- Add a stats tab to the user profile displaying charts and GitHub style streaks info about the todo's and productivity of the user or project
- Create an onboarding flow to set a custom username, avatar etc...
- Modify the todo upload so it supports video's
- Create a cron job and modify the seed script (with an LLM for example) to generate periodic seed data and make the platform look active
- Add a feedback box to the right bottom corner so users can quickly report bugs or suggestions
- Have the todo media open in a lightbox
- Add (hover) animations in the UI to make it feel more interactive (Framer / Auto animation library)
- Create a multi-tenant version so you can sell the platform as a whitelabel platform to businesses (Create your own community basically)
- Add dynamic SEO, metadata and OpenGraph Images to the pages
- Implement optimistic updates to the mutations for a more snappy feel of the app
- Add a membership and billing feature with Stripe
- Create a weekly e-mail report with a cron job or transactional email provider
- Weekly E-mail reports / Transactional email
- Add a search bar to search through projects, todo's and forum items
- Add timezones (Mainly for streaks)
- Add notifications (for example using Postgres with the activity streams pattern)
- Create different feeds, for example following / all for timelines
- Create an Admin Dashboard for managing users
- Implement Logging / Observability / Event Analytics (Pino, Sentry, Segment, Jitsu, PostHog)
- Implement online status blink for users
- Create automatic database back-ups
- Dark theme
